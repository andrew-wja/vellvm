* Introduction

This is a collection of some QuickChick test cases that have failed.

** Possible semantics / clang bugs
*** extract-element-disagreement

Not sure what's happening here, it seems like clang and vellvm
disagree when doing ~extractelement~ on ~i1~ vectors.

** Generator issues
*** use-after-free

This is an issue with our generator in the malloc branch.
