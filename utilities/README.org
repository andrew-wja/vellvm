* Utilities

Some utilities to help with Vellvm development.

** ~vellvm-reduce.sh~

Utility to reduce test cases using [[https://llvm.org/docs/Bugpoint.html][bugpoint]]. This script will run the
program using ~vellvm~ to determine if it spits out an error of some
kind (UB, failure, etc). If the program /does/ have some kind of error
when run with ~vellvm~, it will shrink the program using [[https://llvm.org/docs/Bugpoint.html][bugpoint]],
while attempting to preserve the error message given by ~vellvm~. If
the program /does not/ have some kind of error when run with ~vellvm~
it will run the program using ~clang~, and it will attempt to preserve
the return values from both ~vellvm~ and ~clang~.

Basic usage is as follows:

#+begin_src sh
  ./vellvm-reduce.sh --help
  ./vellvm-reduce.sh --vellvm <VELLVM_EXECUTABLE_PATH> -i <LLVM_FILE_TO_SHRINK> -o <REDUCED_LLVM_OUTPUT_FILE>
#+end_src

*Note:* This script currently spits out a bunch of ~.bc~ files in your current directory.
